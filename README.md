# Assignment 2 - CS5287

# Milestone 1

For this milestone both of us downloaded Vagrant to our local machines. We then edited the Vagrantfile for configuration details. 

Install Vagrant from: https://www.vagrantup.com/

We download the clouds.yaml file from Chameleon Cloud and made sure this file was placed correctly in the new virtual machine. You can locate this file under KVM.Access.Download.

The command `vagrant up` creates a virtual machine in VirtualBox and then automatically installs Ansible and runs an Ansible playbook.

## Distribution of Work  

Parish edited the Vagrant files, and then we both met over Zoom to test and get the playbooks working. Alex then created documentation and a demo video.  

# Milestone 2

With the command vagrant up a vagrant VM is created, and then a [master playbook](github.com/parishwolfe/5287-A2/blob/main/vagrant_ansible/playbook_create_and_provision.yml) is called that subsequently calls a number of other playbooks.  

The Master playbook:

* Creates and configures VM2 and VM3
    * static floating IP
    * static security groups
* Installs dependencies and requirements
    * java runtime
    * python packages
    * Kafka tarball
* Configures both machines
    * Creates kafka user, directories
    * Performs kafka configuration
    * Opens ufw ports
    * writes systemd service files
* Performs additional VM specific configuration
* Starts ZooKeeper on VM2
* Starts Apache Kafka brokers on both VM2 and VM3
* Starts Consumer on VM2 by running an async task

The playbook that spins out two Cloud virtual machines (VM2, VM3) can be found [here](github.com/parishwolfe/5287-A2/blob/main/vagrant_ansible/tasks/create_cc_cloud_vm.yml). We had to find a specific type of clouds.yaml file as the one we had used before was not in the correct format for use here. The playbook to add both machines to the dynamic inventory is [here](github.com/parishwolfe/5287-A2/blob/main/vagrant_ansible/tasks/get_facts_cloud_vm.yml)

The playbook to configure both Cloud machines is [here](github.com/parishwolfe/5287-A2/blob/main/vagrant_ansible/tasks/playbook_setup_both_cloud_vms.yml), and the playbook for VM3's specific configuration is [here](github.com/parishwolfe/5287-A2/blob/main/vagrant_ansible/tasks/playbook_VM3.yml). Initially we were using a dynamic inventory generated by querying openshift, but chose to migrate to static IPs to ease our configuration task complexity.

The playbook to run the consumer code is found [here](github.com/parishwolfe/5287-A2/blob/main/vagrant_ansible/playbook_VM2_run_consumer.yml). We used an asynchronous task to complete this. 

## Configuration details

VM1.1-1.2:

* Python requirements 
* Playbook files
* Code files

VM2:

* Kafka
* Broker_id = 0
* Zookeeper
* Cloned github repo
* Runs Consumer.py

VM3:

* Kafka
* Broker_id = 1
* Cloned github repo
* Destination for couch db next milestone

To install Kafka we created playbooks that followed the instructions found at: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-apache-kafka-on-ubuntu-20-04  

To configure Kafka, we wrote zookeeper.service and kafka.service files that were copied over into the correct directories using a playbook. We then edited the kafka server.properties files on both VMs as needed using a playbook.  

Using playbooks we also made sure all the needed packages were installed on VM2 and VM3. Additionally, there is a playbook that ensures the correct Firewall rules are on each VM.  

## Demo

A demo can be found here. This demo runs master playbook that creates and configures VM2 and VM3, and then runs consumer.py. After the master playbook is finished running we run the producer code from VM1.1 (the vagrant created machine) and the new data is found in CouchDB, showing the consumer received the data. At this time we are utilizing our existing couch db instance.

## Distribution of work

Parish wrote the openshift related ansible modules, while Alex focused on the configuration modules. We came together to test the entire system and film the video. Alex recorded and edited the video, while the documentation for this milestone was a split effort.
