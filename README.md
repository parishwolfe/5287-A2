# Assignment 2 - CS5287

# Milestone 1

For this milestone both of us downloaded Vagrant to our local machines. We then edited the Vagrantfile for configuration details. 

Install Vagrant from: https://www.vagrantup.com/

We download the clouds.yaml file from Chameleon Cloud and made sure this file was placed correctly in the new virtual machine. You can locate this file under KVM.Access.Download.

The command `vagrant up` creates a virtual machine in VirtualBox and then automatically installs Ansible and runs an Ansible playbook.

## Distribution of Work 

Parish edited the Vagrant files, and then we both met over Zoom to test and get the playbooks working. Alex then created documentation and a demo video.
